# Contributing to TapIn

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute ‚Äî we appreciate your interest in improving TapIn!

This project is still early in its development, so we welcome contributions that align with its goals and maintain its quality and security.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

To contribute, first:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/TapIn.git
   cd TapIn
3. Build the project
   ```bash
   make
   ```
   To run tests:
   ```bash
   make test
   ```
3. Add the Upstream Remote

    This keeps your fork up-to-date with the original project:
    
    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/PROJECT_NAME.git
    git remote -v   # check remotes


    origin ‚Üí your fork
    upstream ‚Üí the original project

4. Create a New Branch

    Always create a new branch for your feature or fix:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/short-descriptive-name
    ```

    This keeps main (or master) clean, and makes your PR easier to review.

5. Make Changes and Commit

    Edit code, add tests, or update documentation. Then:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Brief: explain what you changed"

6. Keep Branch in Sync (optional but good practice)

    Fetch latest changes from upstream and rebase:

    ```bash
    git fetch upstream
    git rebase upstream/main
    ```

    This ensures your branch is based on the latest project state.

7. Push Your Branch

    Push your branch to your fork:

    ```bash
    git push origin feature/short-descriptive-name
    ```
8. Open a Pull Request (PR)

    Go to your fork on GitHub.
    You‚Äôll see a banner suggesting to open a PR.
    Choose base repository = original project and base branch = main 
    Compare with your feature branch.
    Add a clear title and description.

9. PR Review and Changes

    Maintainers may request changes ‚Üí update your local branch, commit again, and push. The PR updates automatically.

    Keep discussion constructive and aligned with the [code of conduct](/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

10. PR Merge

    Once approved, a maintainer merges your branch into the upstream project.

    You can then delete your branch both locally and on GitHub.

### ‚úÖ What Makes a Good PR - Acceptable Contributions

New features or improvements to encryption, socket handling, or UX

Portability enhancements (e.g., Windows support, cross-compilation)

Bug fixes or vulnerability patches

Additional unit tests for edge cases or new functionality

Documentation updates (README, man page, usage examples)

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Contributions We May Not Accept

Committed test logs or output files

Superficial or stylistic-only edits

Large-scale refactoring without prior discussion in an issue

##### Pull Request Guidelines

Use descriptive commit messages (e.g., Fix: memory leak in handshake)

Open an issue first for large or structural changes

Keep PRs focused and minimal

Run make test before pushing

Avoid widespread style/formatting changes unless scoped

###### üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Questions or Ideas?

Have an idea but not sure if it fits? Open an issue or start a discussion. It helps others stay aligned and avoids duplicated effort.

Thanks again for helping make TapIn better!
